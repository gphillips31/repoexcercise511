## Google Invests in SmartCities

![Google's Sidewalk Labs](940.png)

Google partners with the city of Toronto to build the first true SmartCity
from the ground up, including a heavy investment in Cross-Laminated Timber
(CLT) buildngs.

>>"For example, on the housing front, a collection of new mixed-use buildings, 
>>up to 30 stories tall, would be built at a cost of $3.9 billion, using mass 
>>timber and modular components constructed at a local factory owned by Sidewalk 
>>Labs. The high-rises would add thousands of units to Toronto’s housing 
>>stock—40 percent of them affordable, Sidewalk says—and 35 percent faster than 
>>normal construction time."
